# Cascade Commons

## A Primer

### Background information

I led the development of [Cascade Commons](https://www.cascadecommons.org/), which is a modern and affordable online tournament platform created by me and my coach Prabhat Aluri. Due to COVID-19, high school speech and debate tournaments could no longer be hosted in physical school campuses. The existing online debating services were cost-probhitive for many local schools and poorly-optimized for speech and debate events. We set out to create an affordable, optimized alternative.

### The purpose of this repo

The theme of this proejct was creating an accessible, homegrown solution for our state. Properiatary, costly software is simply not compatible with this vision. As a result, I'm trying to open-source most of the site. While I doubt we will still be supporting this platform after in-person school resumes (hopefully by the start of the 2021-2022 school year), I can imagine this platform being useful to students and schools in the future. I'm hoping that the open-sourced code will be useful to those future students and schools.

I'm also very new to this whole open-sourced code repository thing, so I'll probably unknowingly break some standards or best practices, sorry about that!
