### Background information

I led the development of [Cascade Commons](https://www.cascadecommons.org/), which is a modern and affordable online tournament platform created by me and my coach Prabhat Aluri. Due to COVID-19, high school speech and debate tournaments could no longer be hosted in physical school campuses. The existing online debating services were cost-probhitive for many local schools and poorly-optimized for speech and debate events.
